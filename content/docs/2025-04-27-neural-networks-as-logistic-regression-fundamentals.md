# Neural Networks as Logistic Regression Fundamentals
=============================================

Hey there, fellow tech enthusiasts. Today we're going to dive into the fascinating world of **neural networks** and explore how they're connected to **logistic regression**. But before we begin, let's set the stage with a clever metaphor. Imagine you're at a music festival, and you're trying to predict whether a person will enjoy a particular song or not. You can use various factors like their age, music preferences, and even the weather to make an educated guess. This is similar to what we do in **machine learning**, where we use data to make predictions about future outcomes.

## What is Logistic Regression?
---------------------------

**Logistic regression** is a fundamental concept in machine learning that allows us to predict the probability of an event occurring based on a set of input factors. It's like trying to guess whether a person will buy a ticket to a concert or not, based on their age, income, and music preferences. We use a **logistic function**, also known as the **sigmoid function**, to map the input data to a probability between 0 and 1.

### The Logistic Function
------------------------

The logistic function is defined as:

```python
import numpy as np

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))
```

This function takes in a input `x` and outputs a probability between 0 and 1. The **sigmoid curve** is an S-shaped curve that maps the input data to a probability.

## Neural Networks as Logistic Regression
--------------------------------------

Now, let's talk about how **neural networks** are connected to **logistic regression**. A neural network is like a music festival with multiple stages, each with its own unique sound. Each stage represents a **layer** in the neural network, and the sound represents the **output** of each layer. The final stage is like the **logistic regression** model, where we use the output of the previous layers to make a prediction.

### The Neural Network Architecture
---------------------------------

A simple neural network architecture for logistic regression can be represented as follows:

```python
import numpy as np

# Input layer
x = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

# Hidden layer
weights = np.array([[0.5, 0.3], [0.2, 0.1]])
hidden_layer = np.dot(x, weights)

# Output layer (logistic regression)
output = sigmoid(hidden_layer)
```

In this example, we have an **input layer** with two features, a **hidden layer** with two neurons, and an **output layer** with one neuron. The **output layer** uses the **sigmoid function** to produce a probability between 0 and 1.

## Training the Neural Network
------------------------------

To train the neural network, we need to define a **loss function** that measures the difference between the predicted output and the actual output. We can use the **binary cross-entropy loss** function, which is commonly used in logistic regression.

```python
import numpy as np

def binary_cross_entropy(y_true, y_pred):
    return -np.mean(y_true * np.log(y_pred) + (1 - y_true) * np.log(1 - y_pred))
```

We can then use an **optimization algorithm** like **stochastic gradient descent** to minimize the loss function and update the weights of the neural network.

## Conclusion
----------

In conclusion, **neural networks** are like music festivals with multiple stages, each with its own unique sound. The final stage is like the **logistic regression** model, where we use the output of the previous layers to make a prediction. By understanding how neural networks are connected to logistic regression, we can build more accurate models and make better predictions. So, the next time you're at a music festival, remember that the sounds you're hearing are like the layers of a neural network, working together to create a beautiful melody.
