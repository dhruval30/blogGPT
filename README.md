# blogGPT

**Live Site:** [blog-gpt.netlify.app](https://blog-gpt.netlify.app)

**blogGPT** is a self-writing blog that publishes a new computer science post every day, fully automated.

It picks a topic, uses Llama 3 to generate a full post in Markdown, and saves everything for the frontend. No humans involved.

Built with Python, React, LLMs and a bit of love.

The goal: build a growing, readable CS knowledge base that writes itself.
