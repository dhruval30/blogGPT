# blogGPT

This started as a fun way to automate daily GitHub commits.  
Then it became something better — a blog that writes itself.

**blogGPT** is a self-writing blog that publishes a new computer science post every day — fully automated.

It picks a topic, uses Llama 3 to generate a full post in Markdown, pulls out 3 smart tags, and saves everything for the frontend. No humans involved.

Built with Python, React, LLMs and a bit of love.

The goal: build a growing, readable CS knowledge base that writes itself.  
*(And yeah... keep my commits going too.)*
